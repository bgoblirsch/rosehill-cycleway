This project proposes that the route should be a two-lane protected bike lane on the west side of Ravenswoodâ€”at least between Bryn Mawr and Peterson where Ravenswood is parallel to the cemetery.</p>
        <p>The <StoryLink to="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/sites/westernavenue/Western_Avenue_Corridor_Study_Adopted.pdf" text="Western Avenue Corridor Study"/> was adopted in November 2022 and proposes replacing the east side parking on Western Ave with a two-way protected bike lane between Berdwyn Ave and Ardmore Ave. The Rosehill Cycleway project proposes that once Peterson Avenue is due for a street resurfacing, the route should be extended northwards on Western to Peterson Ave, then continue eastbound to Ravenswood Avenue, completing the loop.</p>
